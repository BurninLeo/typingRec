# R Package to Analyze Data Collected with the Typing Recorder #

The question type "Typing Recorder" in [SoSci Survey](https://www.soscisurvey.de/)
creates a detailled record of keyboard and mouse activity while respondents produce a text.

The typing data comprises the activity (keystrokes and events) and
changes (text additions and deletions).

The R typingRec package provides functions to compute parameters from these data,
such as typing speed or the relation of typing bursts and pauses.
